High percentiles become especially important in backend services that are called mul‐per‐tiple 
times as part of serving a single end-user request. Even if you make the calls in parallel or 
semi‐parallel, the end‐user request still needs to wait for the slowest of the parallel calls 
to render the request incomplete. It takes just one slow call to make the entire end- user 
request slow, as illus‐pertrated in Figure 1-5. EvenIf only a small percentage of backend calls 
are slow, the per‐chance of getting a slow call increases if an end-users request
